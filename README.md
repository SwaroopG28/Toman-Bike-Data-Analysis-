# Toman Bike Share Price Increase Feasibility Analysis

## Problem Statement

As a Data Analyst for Toman Bike Share, the objective is to assess the feasibility of increasing prices next year. The analysis will involve understanding customer behavior, financial implications, and market conditions to make informed pricing recommendations.

## Approach

1. **Build a Database**: Organize and store relevant data on rides, customers, and finances in a relational database to facilitate efficient analysis.

2. **Develop SQL Queries**: Create SQL queries to extract key metrics such as average ride duration and total revenue, which are crucial for understanding current performance.

3. **Connect Power BI**: Link Power BI to the database to visualize the extracted data effectively.

4. **Build a Dashboard**: Design a dashboard in Power BI that highlights important insights and trends related to bike share usage and financial performance.

5. **Make Recommendations**:
   - **Conservative Increase**: Given the substantial price increase last year, a more conservative increase of 10-15% is recommended to avoid losing customers. For example, if the price in 2022 was $4.99, a 10% increase would set the new price at approximately $5.49, while a 15% increase would be about $5.74.
   - **Market Analysis**: Conduct further research on customer satisfaction and competitive landscape to guide the pricing strategy.
   - **Segmented Pricing Strategy**: Consider different pricing for casual versus registered users based on their price sensitivities.
   - **Monitor and Adjust**: Implement new prices while closely monitoring customer feedback and sales data for potential adjustments.

This structured approach will enable Toman Bike Share to make data-driven decisions regarding their pricing strategy for the upcoming year.
